## <a name="introduction">Introduction

The subject code is responsible for Stream Classification. Final classification is concluded on the basis of temporal probabilities & implemented as server-client architecture. Currently three classes can be classified using subject archiecture.

* News
* Program

The model used in this architecture is ***ConvNext-Tiny***, finetuned using ***Pytorch*** framework for Pakistani news channels.

## <a name="architexture">Architecture

The whole system is based on server-client architecture. This allows easy usablity and integration without multi accelaration devices and extra resource consumption. The macro architecture is shown below:

![Stream Classification Macro Architecture][macro_architecture]

The above macro architecture is based on following pointers:

* Everything is containerized.
* Stream Object can be processed for training data by using either:
  * Single stream object file processor ***(Recommended)***
  * Annotation based file processor
* Training pipeline with fetch data, process it and save trained model onto persistent storage.
* Output resources will be loaded by **Stream Classification Inference Server**, and server will be ready for inference.
* Multiple clients can connect to a single server for inference in ***batched mode***, using GRPC.

The micro architecture is also shown below:

![Stream Classification Micro Architecture][micro_architecture]

The above micro architecture is based on follwoing pointer:

* Everything is containerized.
* Input images will be converted to batches using batch handler.
* Batched of images will be sent to AI inference server using request handler.
* AI inference server handles batched inputs using GRPC with client identification.
* Input batch will be processed to CUDA tensor.
* Inference will be done on ***GPU / CPU*** in Pytorch.
* Classification results will be computed on the basis of temporal probabilities.
* Results are returned to respective client using request handler.
* Request handler on the client side, processes results and make it ready for utilization.

## <a name="cloner">Repository Cloning

The prerequisite for this repository is [***gdown***][gdown_link] library. It is required to download trained resources from Google Drive. The cloning and setup procedure for this repository is given below:

```bash
# To clone repository after setting up gdown
git clone https://github.com/codeadeel/Stream-Classification.git

# To download trained resources
cd ./Stream-Classification
chmod 777 ./get_resources.py
./get_resources.py
```

## <a name="convres">Results

The finetuning for the model is done on Pakistani news channel dataset. Finetuning results are given below:

***Batch Size:*** 64  

***Average Training Loss:*** 0.362  
***Average Training Accuracy:*** 0.857  
***Average Validation Loss:*** 0.156  
***Average Validation Accuracy:*** 0.944  
***Testing Loss:*** 0.0306
